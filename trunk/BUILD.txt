Building with Maven 2

Requires maven 2.0.4

Before building:

XStream uses XSite.  XSite requires Sitemesh-2.3.  Upload request is http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MAVENUPLOAD-1207

Until it is uplaoded, steps to install locally: 

1. svn http://svn.codehaus.org/xsite/trunk/lib xsite-lib
2. cd xsite-lib
3. ./install-bundle.sh
(Windows users can easily execute step-by-step commands of script on a command line terminal)

To build:

mvn clean install

Before deploying:

copy settings-template.xml to ~/.m2/settings.xml adding your Codehaus DAV username and passwords.

To deploy (optionally adding sources and javadoc jars):
mvn deploy [-DperformRelease=true]
