        <p>Out of the box, XStream is able to serialize most objects without the need for custom mappings to be setup.
        The XML produced is clean, however sometimes it's desirable to make tweaks to it. The most common use for this is
        when using XStream to read configuration files and some more human-friendly XML is needed.</p>

        <!-- ************ -->

        <h1>Modification by configuration</h1>
        
        <p>A big part of the standard output of XStream can be configured. It is possible to set aliases for class types
        and field names that are mapped to XML tag or attribute names. Objects that can be represented as simple string
        value can be written as attributes. It is possible to omit fields or to flatten the structure for collections.</p>

        <!-- .................. -->
        
        <h2>Aliases</h2>

        <p>Aliases offer a simple way to use different tag or attribute names in the XML.  The simplest and most commonly
        used tweak in XStream is to alias a fully qualified class to a shorter name.  Another use case is a different field name
        for a class member.  Aliases can be set for following elements:</p>

		<ul>
			<li>Class types mapped to XML tags</li>
			<li>Field names mapped to XML tags</li>
			<li>Internal attributes names of XStream</li>
		</ul>        

		<p>The fat elements in the following example are affected:</p>

<div class="Source XML"><pre>&lt;<b>cat</b>&gt;
  &lt;<b>age</b>&gt;4&lt;/<b>age</b>&gt;
  &lt;<b>name</b>&gt;Garfield&lt;/<b>name</b>&gt;
  &lt;<b>owner</b> <b>type</b>="<b>StandardPerson</b>"&gt;
    &lt;<b>name</b>&gt;Jon Arbuckle&lt;/<b>name</b>&gt;
  &lt;/<b>owner</b>&gt;
&lt;/<b>cat</b>&gt;</pre></div>

        <p>Have a look at the <a href="alias-tutorial.html">Alias Tutorial</a> for examples.</p>

        <!-- .................. -->

        <h2>Attributes</h2>

        <p>XML is quite clumsy to read for fields in separate tags that can represent their content in a short single
        string value.  In such a case attributes can help to shorten the XML and increase readability:</p>

<div class="Source XML"><pre>&lt;cat <b>age="4" name="Garfield"</b>&gt;
  &lt;owner class="StandardPerson" <b>name="Jon Arbuckle"</b>/&gt;
&lt;/cat&gt;</pre></div>

        <p>Attributes are also presented in the <a href="alias-tutorial.html">Alias Tutorial</a>.</p>
          
        <!-- .................. -->

        <h2>Omitted fields</h2>
		
		<p>For a proper deserialization XStream has to write the complete object graph into XML that is referenced by a
		single object.  Therefore XStream has to find a representation that contains all aspects to recreate the 
		objects.</p>
		
		<p>However, some parts might be superfluous e.g. if a member field is lazy initialized and its content
		can be easily recreated.  In such a case a field can be omitted using
		<a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/XStream.html">XStream.omitField(Class, String)</a>.</p>
          
        <!-- .................. -->

        <h2>Implicit collections</h2>
		
		<p>Another use case are collections.  If a class has a field that is a collection, by default all elements of a
		collection are embedded in an element that represents the collection itself.  By configuring the XStream with the 
		<a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/XStream.html">XStream.addImplicitCollection()</a> methods it is
		possible to keep the elements directly as child of the class and the surrouning tag for the collection is
		omitted.  It is even possible todeclare more than one implicit collection for a class, but the elements must be
		distinguishable to populate the different collections correctly at deserialization.</p>
		
		<p>In the following example the Java type representing the farm may have two collections, one for cats and one
		for dogs:</p>
		
<div class="Source XML"><pre>&lt;farm&gt;
  &lt;<b>cat</b>&gt;Garfield&lt;/<b>cat</b>&gt;
  &lt;<b>cat</b>&gt;Arlene&lt;/<b>cat</b>&gt;
  &lt;<b>cat</b>&gt;Nermal&lt;/<b>cat</b>&gt;
  &lt;<b>dog</b>&gt;Odie&lt;/<b>dog</b>&gt;
&lt;/farm&gt;</pre></div>
          
        <!-- .................. -->

        <h2>Field order</h2>
        
        <p>XStream is delivered with a lot of <a href="converter.html">converters</a> for standard types.  Nevertheless
        most objects are processed by converters based on reflection.  They will write the fields of a class in the
        sequence they are defined.  It is possible to implement an algorithm for a different sequence or use an 
        implementation that allows to define the sequence for each type separately.</p>
		
        <!-- ************ -->
        
        <h1>Enhancing XStream</h1>
        
        <p>Sometimes customation is simply not enough to tweak the output. Depending on the use case it is fortunate to
        use specialized converters for own types, mapper implementations that control naming of things more globally or
        use specialized writers to influence the complete output.</p>

        <!-- .................. -->

        <h2>Custom Converters</h2>

        <p>Sometimes the object to serialize contains fields or elements, that have no friendly representation for 
        human beings e.g. if a long value represents in reality a time stamp.  In such cases XStream supports custom
        converters for arbitrary types.  Have a look at the <a href="converter-tutorial.html">Converter Tutorial</a>
        for advanced possibilities.</p>

        <!-- .................. -->

        <h2>Custom Mappers</h2>

        <p>In case of global adjustments it can be helpful to implement an own mapper.  A mapper is used to name things
        and map between the name in the Java world to the name used in the XML representation.  The alias mechanism
        described above is implemented as such a mapper that can be configured.  A typical use case is dropping all
        prefixes for field names like underscores in the resulting XML or omitting the package part of class names.</p>
        
        <p class="highlight">However, keep in mind that the algorithm must work in both directions to support deserialization.</p>

        <!-- .................. -->

        <h2>Custom Writer</h2>

        <p>A custom writer can be used to affect the output completely. XStream itself delivers solutions for different
        use cases like the <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/io/xml/CompactWriter.html">CompactWriter</a>
        that does not insert any white spaces between the XML tags or the 
        <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/io/json/JsonHierarchicalStreamWriter.html">JSON writer</p> that
        produces a complete different output format.</p>
        
        <p>Another use case for such a writer is to drop unwanted XML elements that XStream omits on its own. 
        Especially if the written XML is not used for deserialization it can be useful to ignore internal attributes by
        a custom writer</p>
		
        <!-- ************ -->
        
        <h1>Tweaking the own implementation</h1>
        
        <p>As shown, XStream can be configured and enhanced in multiple way, but sometimes it is easier to tweak the
        implementation of the serialized classes:</p>
        
        <ul>
        	<li>Declaring a field transparent will omit it automatically from the processing</li>
        	<li>Implementing a readResolve method that can be used to initialize additional fields</li>
        	<li>Usage of annotations</li>
        </ul>
		
        <!-- ************ -->
        
        <h1>Preprocessing or postprocessing</h1>

        <h2>XML Transformations</h2>

		<p>Never forget, you're dealing with XML! It is easy to transform XML with an XSLT. XStream is delivered with a SAXSource
		implementation, that allows an XStream instance to be the source of a XML transformer.</p>

        <h3>Example</h3>
		<p>Look at the following stylesheet:</p>

<div class="Source XML"><pre>
&lt;xsl:stylesheet version="1.0" xmlns:xsl="http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform"&gt;
  &lt;xsl:output method="xml" omit-xml-declaration="yes" indent="no"/&gt;
  &lt;xsl:template match="/cat"&gt;
    &lt;xsl:copy&gt;
      &lt;xsl:apply-templates select="mName"/&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:copy&gt;
  &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;</pre></div>

		<p>It is used here to remove the age of the cat on the fly (assuming XSLT is a string with the stylesheet above):</p>
		
<div class="Source Java"><pre>
XStream xstream = new XStream();
xstream.alias("cat", Cat.class);

TraxSource <b>traxSource</b> = new TraxSource(new Cat(4, "Garfield"), <b>xstream</b>);
Writer buffer = new StringWriter();
Transformer transformer = TransformerFactory.newInstance().newTransformer(
    new StreamSource(new StringReader(XSLT)));
transformer.transform(<b>traxSource</b>, new StreamResult(buffer));</pre></div>

        <p>The result in the buffer:</p>

<div class="Source XML"><pre>&lt;cat&gt;
  &lt;mName&gt;Garfield&lt;/mName&gt;
&lt;/cat&gt;</pre></div>
