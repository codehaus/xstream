    <h1 id="Compatibility">Compatibility</h1>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Compatibility_JDK">Which JDK is required to use XStream?</h2>
    <p>1.3 or later.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Compatibility_JVMs">Does XStream behave differently across different JVMs?</h2>

    <p>XStream has two modes of operation: <b>Pure Java</b> and <b>Enhanced</b>. In pure Java mode,
    XStream behaves in the same way across different JVMs, however it's features are limited to what
    reflection allows, meaning it cannot serialize certain classes or fields. In <b>enhanced</b> mode,
    XStream does not have these limitations, however this mode of operation is not available to all JVMs.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Compatibility_enhanced_mode_jvm">Which JVMs allow XStream to operate in enhanced mode?</h2>

    <p>Currently on the Sun, Apple, HP, IBM and Blackdown 1.4 JVMs and onwards.
    Also for Hitachi and SAP from 1.5 and onwards.
    Support for BEA JRockit starting with R25.1.0. 
    For all other JVMs, XStream should be used in pure Java mode.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Compatibility_enhanced_mode_advantage">What are the advantages of using enhanced mode over pure Java mode?</h2>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Compatibility_unsupported_JVM">Are there plans to provide enhanced mode support to other JVMs?</h2>
    <p>Yes. <a href="list-user.html">Let us know</a> which JVM you would like supported.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Compatibility_no_enhanced_mode">When should I use XStream not in enhanced mode?</h2>

    <p>Running XStream in a secured environment can prevent XStream from running in enhanced mode. This is
    especially true when running XStream in an applet. You may also try to use the JavaBeanConverter as alternative to
    the ReflectionConverter running in enhanced or pure Java mode.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Compatibility_SecurityManager">Which permissions does XStream need when running with an active SecurityManager?</h2>

    <p>This depends on the mode XStream is running in. Refer to the
    <a href="http://svn.xstream.codehaus.org/browse/xstream/trunk/xstream/src/test/com/thoughtworks/acceptance/SecurityManagerTest.java">SecurityManagerTest</a>
    for details.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Compatibility_XStream11">Why does XStream 1.2 no longer read XML generated with XStream 1.1.x?</h2>

    <p>The architecture in XStream has slightly changed. Starting with XStream 1.2 the
    <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/io/HierarchicalStreamDriver.html">HierarchicalStreamDriver</a>
    implementation is responsible to ensure that XML tags and attributes are valid names in XML, in XStream 1.1.x
    this responsibility was part of the ClassMapper implementations.  Under some rare circumstances this will result in
    an unreadable XML due to the different processing order in the workflow of such problematic tag names.</p>

    <p>You can run XStream in 1.1 compatibility mode though:</p>

<div class="Source Java"><pre>XStream xstream = new XStream(new XppDriver(new XStream11XmlFriendlyReplacer())) {
    protected boolean useXStream11XmlFriendlyMapper() {
        return true;
    }
};</pre></div>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Compatibility_ConverterAnnotations">XStream 1.3 ignores suddenly annotated converters (@XStreamConverter and @XStreamConverters)?</h2>

    <p>XStream treats now all annotations the same and therefore it no longer auto-detects any annotation by
    default.  You can configure XStream to run in auto-detection mode, but be aware if the 
    <a href="annotations-tutorial.html#AutoDetect">implications</a>.  As alternative you might register the
    deprecated AnnotationReflectionConverter, that was used for XStream pre 1.3.x, but as drawback the functionality
    to register a local converter with XStream.registerLocalConverter will no longer work.</p>


    <!-- ****************************************************** -->
    <h1 id="Serialization">Serialization</h1>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Serialization_omit_field">How do I specify that a field should not be serialized?</h2>
    <p>Make it <code>transient</code>, specify it with <code>XStream.omitField()</code> or
    annotate it with @XStreamOmitField</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Serialization_initialize_transient">How do I initialize a transient field at deserialization?</h2>

    <p>XStream uses the same mechanism as the JDK serialization. Example:</p>

<div class="Source Java"><pre>class ThreadAwareComponent {
  private transient ThreadLocal component;
  // ...
  private Object readResolve() {
    component = new ThreadLocal();
    return this;
  }
}</pre></div>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Serialization_no_ctor_running">XStream is not calling the default constructor during deserialization.</h2>

    <p>This is, in fact, the same case as above. XStream uses the same mechanism as the JDK serialization. When using
    the enhanced mode with the optimized reflection API, it does not invoke the default constructor. The solution is to
    implement the readResolve method as above:</p>

<div class="Source Java"><pre>class MyExecutor {
  private Object readResolve() {
    // do what you need to do here
    System.out.println("After instantiating MyExecutor");
    // at the end returns itself
    return this;
  }
}</pre></div>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Serialization_collections">What do serialized collections look like?</h2>

    <p>Example:</p>

<div class="Source Java"><pre>class Person {
  private String name;
  private List toys = new ArrayList();
  // ...
}

class Computer {
  String type;
}

class Car {
  String color;
}

xstream.alias("person", Person.class);
xstream.alias("computer", Computer.class);
xstream.alias("car", Car.class);

Person person = new Person("Joe");
person.addToy(new Computer("apple"));
person.addToy(new Computer("spectrum"));
person.addToy(new Car("blue"));

String xml = xstream.toXML(joe);</pre></div>

    <p>Results in:</p>

<div class="Source Java"><pre>&lt;person&gt;
  &lt;name&gt;Joe&lt;/name&gt;
  &lt;toys&gt;
    &lt;computer&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;apple&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;/computer&gt;
    &lt;computer&gt;
      &lt;type&gt;spectrum&lt;/type&gt;
    &lt;/computer&gt;
    &lt;car&gt;
      &lt;color&gt;blue&lt;/color&gt;
    &lt;/car&gt;
  &lt;/toys&gt;
&lt;/person&gt;</pre></div>

	<p>Note, that it is possible to configure XStream to omit the container element <i>toys</i> using implicit collections.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Serialization_Serializable">Do my classes have to implement Serializable if XStream is to serialize them?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Serialization_proxies">Can dynamic proxies be serialized?</h2>
    <p>Yes.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Serialization_CGLIB">Can CGLIB proxies be serialized?</h2>
    <p>Only limitedly. A proxy generated with the CGLIB Enhancer is supported, if the
    proxy uses only one callback and the proxy instance can be generated without
    additional constructor arguments.</p>

    <h2 id="Serialization_CGLIB_2.0.1">Serialization fails with NoSuchMethodError: net.sf.cglib.proxy.Enhancer.isEnhanced(Ljava/lang/Class;)Z</h2>
    <p>XStream uses this method to detect a CGLIB-enhanced proxy. Unfortunately the method is not available in the 
    cglib-2.0 version. Since this version is many years old and the method is available starting with cglib-2.0.1, please 
    consider an upgrade of the dependency, it works usually smoothly.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Serialization_sort_fields">Can I select the field order in which XStream serializes objects?</h2>
    <p>Yes. XStream's ReflectionConverter uses the defined field order by default. You can override it by using an specific FieldKeySorter:</p>
<div class="Source Java"><pre>SortableFieldKeySorter sorter = new SortableFieldKeySorter();
sorter.registerFieldOrder(MyType.class, new String[] { "firstToSerialize", "secondToSerialize", "thirdToSerialize" });
xstream = new XStream(new Sun14ReflectionProvider(new FieldDictionary(sorter)));
</pre></div>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Serialization_newer_class_versions">How does XStream deal with newer versions of classes?</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>If a new field is added to the class, deserializing an old version will leave the field uninitialized.</li>
        <li>If a field is removed from the class, deserializing an old version that contains the field will cause an exception.
        Leaving the field in place but declaring it as transient will avoid the exception, but XStream will not try to deserialize it.</li>
        <li>If a class is renamed, aliases can be used to create an abstraction between the name used in XML and the real class name.</li>
        <li>If a field is renamed, this should be treated as adding a field and removing a field.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>For more advanced class migrations, you may</p>
    <ul>
	    <li>have to do custom pre-processing of the XML before sending it to XStream (for example, with XSLT or DOM manipulations)</li>
	    <li>declare new fields as transient</li>
	    <li>implement your own converter, that can handle the situation</li>
	    <li>add a readResolve() method to your class, that initializes the object accordingly</li>
	    <li>implement a custom mapper to ignore unknown fields automatically 
	    (see acceptance test CustomMapperTest.testCanBeUsedToOmitUnexpectedElements())</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Future versions of XStream will include features to make these type of migrations easier.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Serialization_classloader">How does XStream cope with isolated class loaders?</h2>

    <p>Serializing an object graph is never a problem, even if the classes of those objects have been loaded by
    a different class loader. The situation changes completely at deserialization time. In this case you must set the
    class loader to use with:</p>

    <div class="Source Java"><pre>xstream.setClassLoader(yourClassLoader);</pre></div>

	<p>Although XStream caches a lot of type related information to gain speed, it keeps those information in
	tables with weak references that should be cleaned by the garbage collector when the class loader is freed.</p>

    <!-- ****************************************************** -->
    <h1 id="XML">XML specifics</h1>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="XML_respect_XML_declaration">Why does XStream not respect the encoding in the XML declaration?</h2>

    <p>XStream architecture is based on IO Readers and Writers, while the XML declaration is the responsibility of XML
    parsers.  XStream all <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/io/HierarchicalStreamDriver.html">HierarchicalStreamDriver</a>
    implementation respect the encoding since version 1.3, but only if you provide an 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/InputStream.html">InputStream</a>. If XStream consumes a 
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/Reader.html">Reader</a> you have to initialize the reader with 
    the appropriate encoding yourself, since it is now the reader's task to perform the encoding and no XML parser can
    change the encoding of a Reader and any encoding definition in the XML header will be ignored.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="XML_write_XML_declaration">Why does XStream not write a XML declaration?</h2>

    <p>XStream is designed to write XML snippets, so you can embed its output into an existing stream or string.
    You can write the XML declaration yourself into the Writer before using it to call XStream.toXML(writer).</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="XML_write_UTF8">Why does XStream not write XML in UTF-8?</h2>

    <p>XStream does no character encoding by itself, it relies on the configuration of the underlying XML writer.
    By default it uses its own PrettyPrintWriter which writes into the default encoding of the current locale. To write
    UTF-8 you have to provide a <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/io/Writer.html">Writer</a>
    with the appropriate encoding yourself.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="XML_double_underscores">Why do field names suddenly have double underscores in the generated XML?</h2>

    <p>XStream maps Java class names and field names to XML tags or attributes. Unfortunately this mapping cannot
    be 1:1, since some identifiers of Java contain a dollar sign which is invalid in XML names. Therefore XStream uses an
    <a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/io/xml/XmlFriendlyReplacer.html">XmlFriendlyReplacer</a> to replace
    this character with a replacement. By default this replacement uses an underscore and therefore the replacer must
    escape the underscore itself also. You may provide a different configured instance of the XmlFriendlyReplacer or a
    complete own implementation, but you must ensure, that the resulting names are valid for XML.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="XML_unmarshalling_fails">XStream fails to unmarshal my given XML and I do not know why?</h2>

    <p>By default XStream is written for persistence i.e. it will read the XML it can write. If you have to transform a given
    XML into an object graph, you should go the other way round. Use XStream to transfer your objects into XML. If the 
    written XML matches your schema, XStream is also able to read it. This way is much easier, since you can spot the 
    differences in the XML much more easy than to interpret the exceptions XStream will throw if it cannot match the XML
    into your objects.</p>


    <!-- ****************************************************** -->
    <h1 id="JSON">JSON specifics</h1>

    <h2 id="JSON_2_drivers">Why are there two JSON driver implementations?</h2>

	<p>As always, first for historical reasons! Main difference is that the 
	<a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/io/json/JettisonMappedXmlDriver.html">JettisonMappedXmlDriver</a> is a 
	thin wrapper around <a href="http://jettison.codehaus.org">Jettison</a> in combination with the 
	<a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/io/xml/StaxDriver.html">StaXDriver</a>, while the 
	<a href="javadoc/com/thoughtworks/xstream/io/json/JsonHierarchicalStreamDriver.html">JsonHierarchicalStreamDriver</a>
	uses an own more flexible implementation, but can only be used to generate JSON, deserialization is not implemented.</p>

    <h2 id="JSON_deserialize_top_level_array">Why is it not possible to deserialize a JSON string starting with an array?</h2>

	<p>XStream's implementation to deserialize JSON is based on Jettison and StaX. Jettison implements a XMLStreamReader
	of	StaX and transforms the processed JSON virtually into XML first. However, if the JSON string starts with an array it is not
	possible for Jettison to create a valid root element, since it has no name.</p>

    <h2 id="JSON_unmarshalling_fails">XStream fails to unmarshal my JSON string and I do not know why?</h2>

    <p>Deserialization of JSON is currently done by Jettison, that transforms the JSON string into a StaX stream.
    XStream itself does nothing know about the JSON format here. If your JSON string reaches some kind of
    complexity and you do not know how to design your Java objects and configure XStream to match those,
    you should have a look at the intermediate XML that is processed by XStream in the end. This might help to
    identify the problematic spots. Also consider then <a href="#XML_unmarshalling_fails">marshalling your Java
    objects into XML first</a>. You can use following code to generate the XML:</p>

<div class="Source Java"><pre>final String json = "{string:\"foo\"}";
final HierarchicalStreamDriver driver = new JettisonMappedXmlDriver();
final StringReader reader = new StringReader(json);
final HierarchicalStreamReader hsr = driver.createReader(reader);
final StringWriter writer = new StringWriter();
new HierarchicalStreamCopier().copy(hsr, new PrettyPrintWriter(writer));
writer.close();
System.out.println(writer.toString());
</pre></div>

    <h2 id="JSON_limitations">What limitations has XStream's JSON support?</h2>

	<p>JSON represents a very simple data model for easy data transfer. Especially it has no equivalent for XML
	attributes.  Those are written with a leading &quot;@&quot; character, but this is not always possible without
	violating the syntax (e.g. for array types).  Those may silently dropped (and makes it therefore difficult to
	implement deserialization).  Another issue are references in the serialized object graph, since JSON has no
	possibility to express such a construct.  You should therefore always set the NO_REFERENCES mode of XStream.</p>

    <h2 id="JSON_encoding">Why are there invalid characters in my JSON representation?</h2>

	<p>The JSON spec requires any JSON string to be in UTF-8 encoding. However, XStream ensures this only if you
	provide an InputStream or an OutputStream.	If you provide a Reader or Writer you have to ensure this requirement 
	on your own.</p>

    <!-- ****************************************************** -->
    <h1 id="Scalability">Scalability</h1>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Scalability_Thread_safety">Is XStream thread safe?</h2>

    <p>Yes. Once the XStream instance has been created and configured, it may be shared across multiple threads
    allowing objects to be serialized/deserialized concurrently (unless you enable the auto.detection and processing of
    annotations).</p>

    <!-- ****************************************************** -->
    <h1 id="Uses">Uses of XStream</h1>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Uses_Data_Binding">Is XStream a data binding tool?</h2>

    <p>No. It is a serialization tool.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Uses_Generate_Code">Can XStream generate classes from XSD?</h2>

    <p>No. For this kind of work a data binding tool such as <a href="http://xmlbeans.apache.org">XMLBeans</a> is appropriate.</p>

    <!-- ...................................................... -->
    <h2 id="Uses_No_SAX_Reader">Why is there no SaxReader?</h2>

    <p>XStream works on a stream-based parser model, while SAX is event-based.  The steam based model implies, that the
    caller consumes the individual tokens from the XML parser on demand, while in an event-based model the parser
    controls the application flow on its own and will use callbacks to support client processing.  The different
    architecture makes it therefore impossible for XStream to use an event-driven XML parser.</p>
