    <p>Not yet released</p>

    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>
    	<li>New NameCoder interface and implementations to support a generic name translation between names from the object graph and a target
    	format. The new XmlFriendlyNameCoder replaces the XmlFriendlyReplacer used for XML.</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-542: The XppDriver uses now the official XmlPullParser API to locate an available parser using the XmlPullParserFactory. This 
    	allows the usage of XPP technology with XStream in Android.</li>
    	<li>Additional explicit XPP drivers for the Xpp3 and kXML2 implementations.</li>
    	<li>Additional explicit XPP DOM drivers for the Xpp3 and kXML2 implementations.</li>
    	<li>Additional explicit StAX drivers for Woodstox, BEA StAX and SJSXP of the JDK 6 implementations.</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-556: DateConverter uses format with 3-letter time zones that are ambiguous. Therefore it will now always use UTC to write dates.
    	Unmarshalled dates are not affected as long as they contain a time zone.</li>
    	<li>The type java.lang.reflect.Field is now handled by an own converter, that can still read the old format.</li>
    	<li>The XppReader no longer uses a BufferedReader. This is added now by the XppDriver implementations creating the HierarchicalStreamReader
    	to allow overriding the creation method.</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-490: Provide path in Converter for contexts that track the path.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Minor changes</h2>

    <ul>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-543: Better deserialization support of the defined-in system attribute in combination with field aliases.</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-551: Deprecated XStream.InitializationException still thrown instead of InitializationException.</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-540: Support Jettison-based configuration of JettisonMappedXmlDriver (by Doug Daniels).</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-605: Upgrade to Jettison 1.2 (for Java 5 or higher).</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-552: Improve performance of ReflectionProvider (by Keith Kowalczykowski).</li>
    	<li>Possibility to generate XPath expressions that select always a single node instead of a node list.</li>
    	<li>Implicit collection functionality will no longer use custom collection converters that may write tags that are not
    	recognized at deserialization time again.</li>
    	<li>Improve exception output in case of a missing field.</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-555: StAX driver tests do not honor repairing mode.</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-570: The @XStreamConverter provides now also the current type as possible constructor argument.</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-571: Cannot serialize synchronized RandomAccessList types.</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-583: BinaryDriver fails to handle Strings with more than 64K bytes.</li>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-584: Race condition in XmlFriendlyReplacer.</li>
    	<li>The ConversionException hides information if its ErrorWriter contains the added key already.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

    <ul>
    	<li>Any deprecated stuff of the 1.2.x releases has been removed.</li>
    	<li>Deprecated constructors of c.t.x.io.xml.XppReader, new versions take an additional argument for the XmlPullParser.</li>
    	<li>Deprecated c.t.x.io.xml.XppReader.createParser(), the XPP parser is now created by the driver.</li>
    	<li>Package c.t.x.io.xml.xppdom is now part of the official API.</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.io.xml.xppdom.Xpp3Dom and c.t.x.io.xmlxpp.dom.Xpp3DomBuilder have been deprecated. Functionality is
    	merged in c.t.x.io.xml.xppdom.XppDom.</li>
    	<li>Deprecated c.t.x.mapper.XStream11XmlFriendlyMapper, should have been done some versions ago.</li>
    	<li>Added interface c.t.x.core.ReferencingMarshallingContext which is implemented by all referencing marshallers.</li>
    	<li>Added interface c.t.x.io.naming.NameCoder and implementations.</li>
    	<li>Deprecated c.t.x.io.xml.XmlFriendlyReplacer, c.t.x.io.xml.XmlFriendlyReader and c.t.x.io.xml.XmlFriendlyWriter.</li>
    	<li>Deprecated c.t.x.io.xml.AbstractXmlDriver, c.t.x.io.xml.AbstractXmlReader and c.t.x.io.xml.AbstractXmlWriter, added
    	c.t.x.io.AbstractDriver, c.t.x.io.AbstractReader and c.t.x.io.AbstractWriter instead.</li>
    	<li>Deprecated all constructors of Driver, Reader and Writer implementations that take a XmlFriendlyReplacer as argument,
    	added constructors taking a NameCoder instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="1.3.1">1.3.1</h1>

    <p>Released 6 December 2008.</p>
    
    <p class="highlight">CGLIB support must be explicitly activated now. The decision has been made due to possible problems using an own
    classloader and because of ongoing complaints about occurring exceptions in the CGLIBEnhancedConverter at XStream initialization although
    they are caused by incompatible ASM versions on the user's classpath (JIRA:XSTR-469, JIRA:XSTR-513 and JIRA:XSTR-518).</p>
    
    <p class="highlight">XStream uses some attributes on its own. Until now it was possible to use XStream.aliasAttribute to define a different
    name. This does still work but is deprecated for system attributes. Use the new call XStream.aliasSystemAttribute for such an alias.</p>

    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>
    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-515: CGLIB support is no longer activated automatically and has to be

    	<li>Deprecated c.t.x.io.json.JsonHierarchicalStreamWriter in favour of c.t.x.io.json.JsonWriter.</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.mapper.EnumMapper no longer derives from the c.t.x.mapper.AttributeMapper as it has been before version 1.3. Therefore the new 
    	constructor has been deprecated in favour of the old one.</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute(Class, String) has been deprecated in favour of
    	c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute(Class, String, Class) taking the type as third argument that should be handled by the

    	<li>JIRA:XSTR-430: Fields written as attributes could not be omitted.</li>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

    <ul>
    	<li>c.t.x.annotation.Annotations, c.t.x.annotation.AnnotationReflectionConverter and c.t.x.annotation.AnnotationProvider deprecated.
    	Functionality is integrated in new c.t.x.mapper.AnnotationMapper and accessible with new methods c.t.x.XStream.processAnnotations().</li>
    	<li>New auto-detection mode for annotations, that can be turned on with c.t.x.XStream.autodetectAnnotations()</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.annotation.@XStreamContainedType deprecated, the behaviour is now always active and the annotation therefore superfluous.</li>
    	<li>Due to JIRA:XSTR-421 null characters are no longer written as tag with an attribute (&lt;char null=&quot;true&quot;/&gt;), 
    	but as empty tag.  The old representation is still supported at deserialization.</li>
    	<li>Characters that are not defined in unicode or ISO control characters (expect TAB and LF) are written as numerical entity now.</li>
    	<li>XPath references are now also XML-friendly encoded to match the path exactly.  Unencoded references will normally work anyway,
    	but in special cases the exact behaviour of XStream 1.2.x might be necessary.  See acceptance tests for XStream 1.2.x compatibility.</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.core.BaseException deprecated in favour of c.t.x.XStreamException as base exception for all exceptions XStream throws.</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.XStream.InitializerException deprecated in favour of c.t.x.InitializerException.</li>
    	<li>New methods get() and keys() in interface c.t.x.converter.ErrorWriter.</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.mapper.XmlFriendlyMapper deprecated, technology is replaced since version 1.2 by c.t.x.io.xml.XmlFriendlyReplacer as part of the
    	 different XmlWriter implementations.</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.aliasForAttribute() and c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.attributeForAlias() deprecated, since it provided in reality the combined
    	functionality of c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.serializedMember()/realMember() and c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromItemType().</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.XStream(ReflectionProvider, Mapper, HierarchicalStreamDriver) deprecated, in favour of 
    	c.t.x.XStream(ReflectionProvider, HierarchicalStreamDriver, Mapper, ClassLoader).</li>
    	<li>New interface c.t.x.converter.ConverterRegistry to express explicit functionality managing the converters.</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.core.DefaultConverterLookup no longer uses a c.t.x.mapper.Mapper. Therefore the old constructor has been deprecated in favour
    	of a default constructor.</li>
    	<li>Overloaded methods of c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromItemType and c.t.x.mapper.Mapper.getConverterFromAttribute have been
    	deprecated. Only one version has been kept, the implementation can handle all cases now at once and therefore multiple calls to the mapper chain 
    	are avoided.</li>
    	<li>c.t.x.mapper.EnumMapper derives now from the c.t.x.mapper.AttributeMapper to support enums as attributes. Therefore the old constructor
    	has been deprecated in favour of one taking an additional c.t.x.converters.ConverterLookup that has to be passed to the new parent.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p class="highlight">Note, to support a representation of null values in some way, it is absolutely necessary that each converter can handle a null
    value in its marshalling methods.  If you have implemented your own custom converters, try to handle such a case also to prevent incompatibilities
    in case XStream will provide such values with its next major version.</p>

    <h1 id="1.2.2">Version 1.2.2</h1>

    <p>Released 24 May 2007.</p>

    <p class="hightlight">Note, that next version of XStream will behave slightly different by default.  XStream emits
    all fields in declaration order like Java serialization.  But in contrast to Java it will omit the fields of parent
    classes last while Java serialization emits them first.  This makes it difficult to match a given XML schema that
    defined inherited types or leads sometimes to obscure initialization problems.  However, XStream itself will not be
    affected by the changed order of elements in the XML, any deserialization of current XML representations will work
    fine.  Anyway we will provide with XStream 1.3 a FieldKeySorter implementation that mimics the old behaviour.  In
    the meanwhile you can enforce the new field sorting by installing the NaturalFieldKeySorter.</p>

    <h1 id="1.1.1">Version 1.1.1</h1>

    <p>Released Mar 7, 2005. Mostly bugfixes and minor feature enhancements.</p>

    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h1 id="1.1">Version 1.1</h1>

    <p>Released Jan 15, 2005. Focus on support for objects defining custom serialization using the standard
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/guide/serialization/spec/serialTOC.html">Java serialization</a> mechanism.</p>

    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>Provides drop in replacement for ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream, using XStream.createObjectInputStream() and
        XStream.createObjectOutputStream() and XStream.createObjectInputStream(). This provides support for streaming objects.</li>
        <li>Support for objects that specify their own serialization schemes by implementing readObject() and writeObject()
        (as in Java serialization spec). This includes support for ObjectInputStream.getFields() and ObjectOuputStream.putFields().</li>
        <li>Support for objects to serialize other objects to the stream by implementing writeReplace() (as in Java serialization spec).</li>
        <li>Support for any object that performs custom serialization by implementing java.io.Externalizable (as in Java serialization spec).</li>
        <li>Implicit collections can be specified for classes, allowing the element wrapping the collection to be skipped.</li>
        <li>New writer implementations to allow XStream to serialize directly to a SAX stream or TrAX pipeline.</li>
        <li>The MarshallingContext and UnmarshallingContext interfaces now extend DataHolder, allowing arbitrary data to be stored
        by the user whilst walking the object graph and passed around to Converters. DataHolders can also be passed into
        XStream from the outside.</li>
        <li>Includes new DomWriter implementation to serialize directly to a W3C DOM tree (to complement the existing DomReader).</li>
        <li>Better support for instantiating objects on non Sun 1.4+ JVMs, including non-public constructors, private static inner classes and
        ANY class that implements java.io.Serializable.</li>
        <li>DOM, DOM4J, JDOM, XOM, Electric-XML, SAX, STAX</li>
        <li>Specific ClassLoaders can be passed into XStream, to allow for greater compatibility in J2EE containers.</li>
        <li>Ability to change the default converter</li>
        <li>Added optional ISO8601DateConverter for full ISO8601 date format support. The converter is not registered by default
        as it requires the joda-time dependency (http://joda-time.sf.net). To use, ensure joda-time is in classpath and register explicitly.</li>
        <li>Enhanced mode is now supported on the Apple 1.4 JDK.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Minor changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>PrettyPrintWriter only flushes stream when necessary - large performance improvement for serialization.</li>
        <li>Added XStream.fromXml(xml, root) convenience methods for deserializing into an existing root object.</li>
        <li>JDK 1.3 compatibility: Added mechanism for accessing nested exception.</li>
        <li>JDK 1.3 compatibility: GregorianCalendarConverter only calls Calendar.getTimeInMillis() the JDK supports it.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: All caches are now synchronized - there were some thread safety issues.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Only <i>immutable</i> basic types will have references ignored in XML (for clarity).</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Class names can contain underscores.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Support for '\0' char.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: PropertyConverter no longer attempts to serialize subclasses of Properties.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: JVM detection uses system properties, which is more accurate than searching the classpath.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>XStream.addDefaultCollection() has been deprecated. Use XStream.addImplicitCollection() instead.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="1.0.2">Version 1.0.2</h1>

    <p>Released Aug 7, 2004. Focus on improving the converters bundled with XStream to support a wider range of types.</p>

    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>XML elements are written in order they are defined in class, rather than alphabetical.</li>
        <li>Converters for java.io.File, java.sql.Timestamp, java.awt.Color, and dynamic proxies are now
        registered by default.</li>
        <li>EncodedByteArrayConverter is now registered by default and uses a single Base64 string to store the contents
        of a byte[]. This now works on all JVMs as it no longer relies on Sun specific classes. This converter will also
        unmarshal byte[] that have been serialized without it, for backwards compatability.</li>
        <li>New converters for java.sql.Time, java.sql.Date, java.util.Locale, java.util.Currency, java.util.Calendar
        and java.awt.Font.</li>
        <li>All caching is done in XStream instance instead of statics, allowing applications that use hot redeployment
        of classes to use XStream in a parent classloader.</li>
        <li>XStream will fail fast if a field value is defined more than once in XML when deserializing.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Minor changes</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>The &lt;entry&gt; element used in Maps can now be specified by creating an alias for java.util.Map.Entry.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Fields with characters that generate invalid XML (such as $ signs) are now escaped.</li>
        <li>Bugfix: Pre-instantiated objects can be unmarshalled through multiple levels.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

      <li>Massive performance improvements. Up to 3 times faster for serialization and 22
      times faster for deserialization!</li>
      <li>Non-DOM building pull parser based reader. Results in much smaller memory footprint,
      particularly when deserializing large object models.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Minor changes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Misc performance improvements.</li>
      <li>Misc bugfixes.</li>
      <li>Alternate encodings can be used with DomDriver.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Renamed XMLReader/Writer to HierarchicalStreamReader/Writer as XStream is not
      actually coupled to serializing just to XML.</li>
      <li>Cleaned up the public API.</li>
      <li>Moved internal XStream implementation classes to core package.</li>
      <li>Misc package/class renames to make more sense. Dumped lots of dead code.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="0.4">Version 0.4</h1>

    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Overhaul of interface for Converters. Makes Converters much cleaner to write.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Minor changes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Added custom converters for java.io.File, java.util.Properties, java.util.Vector, java.util.Hashtable, java.util.BitSet
      byte[] (Base64 encoded), char[].</li>
      <li>Misc bugfixes.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>New interface to be implemented by custom converters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="0.3">Version 0.3</h1>

    <p>Released January 1, 2004.</p>

    <h2>Major changes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Added ElementMapper interface and default implementations to allow fine
      grained control over element name to class mapper operations.</li>
      <li>Added an XPP based reader and writer that uses a pull-parser to create a lightweight DOM tree.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Minor changes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Added XStream.fromXML(XMLReader xmlReader,Object root) method to
        allow the population of an object graph starting with a live object root.</li>
      <li>Added XMLReader.peek() method to allow access to the underlying hierarchical
        object being unmarshalled.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>API changes</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Aligned the the methods in XStream to use the specified ObjectFactory in the constructor
        instead of creating a SunReflectionObjectFactory.</li>
    </ul>

    <h1 id="older">Older versions</h1>

    <p>Changes in XStream prior to version 0.3 were not logged.</p>
