        <p>XStream is used in a lot of commercial and open source projects and is used in production since years.</p>

        <!-- ************ -->

        <h1>XStream used for Core Technology</h1>

        <h2>Atlassian Confluence</h2>

        <p><a href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/">Confluence</a> is an enterprise wiki that makes it 
        easy for your team to collaborate and share knowledge.</p>

        <h2>Apache Muse</h2>

        <p>The <a href="http://ws.apache.org/muse">Apache Muse Project</a> is a Java-based implementation of the
        WS-ResourceFramework (<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/wsrf">WSRF</a>),
        WS-BaseNotification (<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/wsn">WSN</a>), and 
        WS-DistributedManagement (<a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/wsdm">WSDM</a>) specifications.
        It is a framework upon which users can build web service interfaces for manageable resources without having to 
        implement all of the "plumbing" described by the aforementioned standards. Applications built with Muse can be 
        deployed in  both Apache Axis2 and OSGi environments, and the project includes a set of command line tools that
        can generate the proper artifacts for your deployment scenario.</p>

        <h2>NanoContainer</h2>

        <p>The scope of the NanoContainer project is to complement the PicoContainer project, providing it with additional functionality.
        The project comprises of several components which can either be adaptions in various guises of PicoContainer (e.g. composition 
        by-class-name rather than by-class), or adaptations to external components bringing them closer to the 
        <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/PICO/Dependency+Injection">Dependency Injection</a> ideal - particularly 
        <a href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/PICO/Constructor+Injection">Constructor Injection</a>.</p>

        <h1>XStream Support</h1>

        <h2>ActiveSOAP</h2>

        <p><a href="http://activesoap.codehaus.org">ActiveSOAP</a> is a lightweight &amp; easily embeddable 
        <a href="http://activesoap.codehaus.org/REST">REST</a> and SOAP stack based on 
        <a href="http://activesoap.codehaus.org/StAX">StAX</a> with support for 
        <a href="http://activesoap.codehaus.org/WS-Addressing">WS-Addressing</a> and 
        <a href="http://activesoap.codehaus.org/WSIF">WSIF</a>. ActiveSOAP uses StAX (the Standard API for pull parsing) 
        to implement the SOAP protocols and then it delegates to plugin 
        <a href="http://activesoap.codehaus.org/maven/apidocs/org/codehaus/activesoap/Handler.html">Handler</a> objects 
        for the heavy duty processing of the XML payloads. This means that you only need to pay for what you need; use fast 
        pull based event parsing or full data binding mechanisms like JAXB or XStream or DOMish APIs like XMLBeans when they 
        make sense.</p>
