			<p>XStream is a simple library to serialize objects to XML and back again.</p>
			<p>XStream requires minimal (if any at all) configuration for custom objects.</p>
			<p>The XML produced is clean and concise and never duplicates any information that
			can be obtained via reflection.</p>
			<p>XStream has a clean design, is simple to use, boasts impressive speed and is
			not coupled to any particular XML library.</p>
