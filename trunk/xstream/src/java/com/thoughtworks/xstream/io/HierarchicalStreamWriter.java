     * Return the underlying HierarchicalStreamWriter implementation.

     * If a Converter needs to access methods of a specific HierarchicalStreamWriter implementation that are not defined
     * in the HierarchicalStreamWriter interface, it should call this method before casting. This is because the writer
     * passed to the Converter is often wrapped/decorated by another implementation to provide additional functionality
     * (such as XPath tracking).
     * </p>
     * <p>
     * For example:
     * </p>
     * 
     * <pre>
     * MySpecificWriter mySpecificWriter = (MySpecificWriter)writer; <b>// INCORRECT!</b>
     * mySpecificWriter.doSomethingSpecific();
     * </pre>
     * 
     * <pre>
     * MySpecificWriter mySpecificWriter = (MySpecificWriter)writer.underlyingWriter();  <b>// CORRECT!</b>
     * mySpecificWriter.doSomethingSpecific();
     * </pre>
     * <p>
     * Implementations of HierarchicalStreamWriter should return 'this', unless they are a decorator, in which case they
     * should delegate to whatever they are wrapping.
     * </p>
