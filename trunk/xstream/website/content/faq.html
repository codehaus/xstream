    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

    <h1>Compatability</h1>

    <h2>Which JDK is required to use XStream?</h2>
    <p>Currently 1.4 or later. However there are plans to get XStream working on 1.3 in the near future.</p>

    <h1>Serialization</h1>

    <h2>How do I specify that a field should not be serialized?</h2>
    <p>Make it <code>transient</code>.</p>

    <h2>How do I serialize binary data in a byte array?</h2>
    <p>You need to register a special a Converter:</p>
    <div class="Source Java"><pre>xstream.registerConverter(new EncodedByteArrayConverter());</pre></div>
    <p>This will store binary data in XML by BASE-64 encoding it.</p>
    <p>It is not registered by default as the encoding classes are not part of the standard JDK.</p>

    <h2>Do my classes have to implement Serializable if XStream is to serialize them?</h2>
    <p>No.</p>
