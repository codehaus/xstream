<p>Support of Hibernate enhanced collections and proxied types.
To drop the internals of Hibernate when marshalling such objects to XStream,
all converters and the mapper has to be registered for the XStream instance:</p>
<p><code><pre>final XStream xstream = new XStream() {
  protected MapperWrapper wrapMapper(final MapperWrapper next) {
    return new HibernateMapper(next);
  }
};
xstream.registerConverter(new HibernateProxyConverter());
xstream.registerConverter(new HibernatePersistentCollectionConverter(xstream.getMapper()));
xstream.registerConverter(new HibernatePersistentMapConverter(xstream.getMapper()));
xstream.registerConverter(new HibernatePersistentSortedMapConverter(xstream.getMapper()));
xstream.registerConverter(new HibernatePersistentSortedSetConverter(xstream.getMapper()));
</pre></code></p>
