	<h2 id="modules">Modules</h2>

	XStream project consists of several modules:
	<ol>
		<li>xstream - the core module</li>
		<li>xstream-benchmark - the benchmark tool</li>
		<li>xstream-distribution - the module contains the documentation and assembles the src and bin distributions</li>
	</ol>
	When you checkout the trunk you'll get all the modules, but you can just add the module you are interested in to the URL, e.g.
		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co http://svn.codehaus.org/xstream/trunk/[module]</pre></div>
	to checkout out the single module separately.

	<h2 id="browser">Browser</h2>

	<p>You can use the browser to navigate within the sources <a href="http://fisheye.codehaus.org/browse/xstream/trunk/">online</a>
	with the help of the FishEye installation on Codehaus.</p>

    <h2 id="subversion">Subversion</h2>

    XStream uses Subversion as the SCM.  See <a href="http://subversion.apache.org">Subversion website</a> for details and documentation on IDE integration.

	<h2 id="webdav">WebDav Access</h2>

	WebDav is an access protocol supported by SVN and being http-based is often allowed by corporate firewalls.

	<h3 id="webdav-anon">Anonymous Access</h3>

		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co http://svn.codehaus.org/xstream/trunk</pre></div>
		
		<p>
		You might also use this URL to <a href="http://svn.codehaus.org/xstream/trunk">browse the repository</a> in a simple manner.
		</p>

	<h3 id="webdav-auth">Committer Access</h3>

		<div class="Source"><pre>svn co https://svn.codehaus.org/xstream/trunk</pre></div>

		<p>
		This access protocol is available to all, but only developers can commit changes.
		</p>
		<p>
		Developers require a LDAP password for Codehaus username (contact Bob at the Haus to get assigned a password if you don't have one).
