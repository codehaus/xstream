    <h2 id="1.4"><b>Aug 6, 2011</b> XStream 1.4 released</h2>

      <p>Finally - XStream 1.4 is ready for delivery.  A lot of things have changed and improved, new features added.
      Nevertheless we have maintain compatibility to the old versions:</p>
      
      <ul>
      	<li>Detection of Java 7 and Android i.e. enabled enhanced mode and annotations for both environments out of the box</li>
      	<li>Direct support of XmlPullParser factory and alternate kXML2 implementation</li>
      	<li>Explicit drivers to select the StAX implementation</li>
      	<li>New separate Hibernate module to support those managed instances (special thanks to Jaime Metcher)</li>
      	<li>Support of implicit arrays and maps additionally to already existing implicit collection support</li>
      	<li>Performance improvements (special thanks to Keith Kowalczykowski)</li>
      	<li>Some new converters (for URI and one to write all fields but one as attributes)</li>
      	<li>A lot of other enhancements and bug fixes</li>
      </ul>

	<p>Thanks to this impressive list of <a href="team.html#contributors">contributors</a>.</p>
      
    <p class="hightlight">Note, that with version 1.4 the default parser has been changed from
    <a href="faq.html#Compatibility_kXML2">Xpp3 to kXML2</a>.</p>
      
    <p class="hightlight">Note, that JDK 1.3 support has been officially dropped.  Nothing special has been done to
    enforce this, but there is no longer any support.</p>

    <p class="highlight">Note, to support a representation of null values in some way, it is absolutely necessary that each converter can handle a null
    value in its marshalling methods.  If you have implemented your own custom converters, try to handle such a case also to prevent incompatibilities
    in case XStream will provide such values with its next major version.</p>

    <h2 id="1.3.1"><b>Dec 6, 2008</b> XStream 1.3.1 released</h2>

      <p>A new XStream maintenance version has been released.  The release contains some
      bug fixes, some minor enhancements and support of new JDKs:</p>
      
      <ul>
      	<li>Ability to alias package names</li>
      	<li>Converters are only registered by default for types delivered with the JDK in use preventing
      	unexpected incompatibilities</li>
      	<li>Separation between user defined attributes and XStream attributes</li>
      	<li>New mode for JSONWriter to drop JSON root node</li>
      	<li>Support for FreeBSD's Diablo JDK.</li>
      	<li>Enhanced persistence package and extended tutorial.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>View the complete <a href="changes.html">change log</a> and <a href="download.html">download</a>.</p>
      
    <p class="hightlight">Note, that XStream really supports by default now only types of the JDK in use.  Especially for
    CGLIB this means that support of those proxies will have to be <a href="faq.html#Serialization_CGLIB">explicitly activated</a>
    first. However, support for CGLIB proxies has been enhanced.</p>

    <p class="highlight">Note, to support a representation of null values in some way, it is absolutely necessary that each converter can handle a null
    value in its marshalling methods.  If you have implemented your own custom converters, try to handle such a case also to prevent incompatibilities

    <h2 id="1.3"><b>Feb 27, 2008</b> XStream 1.3 released</h2>
    
      <p>The XStream committers proudly present XStream 1.3.  This release contains some major
      refactorings concerning Java annotations, improved XML support regarding encoding and 
      character sets, some minor new features, deprecations and a lot of bug fixes:</p>
      
	  <ul>
        <li>Annotation support is now implemented as Mapper and Annotations can either be processed
        in advance or on-the-fly (see <a href="annotations-tutorial.html#AutoDetect">Annotations tutorial</a>
        for limitations).</li>
        <li>Improved encoding support for JSON and XML (including automated  support for XML headers).
        Enforceable check for valid XML characters in the written stream.</li>
        <li>Dedicated converters can now be configured for individual fields also using the XStream facade.</li>
        <li>New converters for java.lang.StringBuilder, java.util.UUID, javax.xml.datatype.Duration,
         and javax.swing.LookAndFeel. New generic converter for types using a java.beans.PropertyEditor.
         Auto-instantiated SingleValueConverter for Java enums to support enum values as attributes.</li>
        <li>XML elements are now sorted by default according their declaration with the fields defined in parent
        classes first to improve support for type hierarchies in XML schemata.</li>
        <li>A lot of bug fixes to improve JSON support for arbitrary types. Added section in 
        <a href="faq.html#JSON">FAQ</a> for limitations and operation modes.</li>
        <li>Native support for SAP VM.</li>
        <li>All text-based files are now shipped with an appropriate license header to clean-up legal issues.</li>
   	  </ul>

    <h2 id="1.2.2"><b>May 24, 2007</b> XStream 1.2.2 released</h2>
    
    <p>A maintenance release of XStream that contains a lot of bug fixes and has some minor highlights:
    
	  <ul>
    	<li>JSON serialization and deserialization support with the help of the new JettisonMappedXmlDriver</li>
        <li>Supports customized field sorting</li>
        <li>Omitting fields at deserialization time</li>
   	  </ul>
      <p>View the complete <a href="changes.html">change log</a> and <a href="download.html">download</a>.</p>
      
    <p class="hightlight">Note, that next version of XStream will behave slightly different by default.  XStream emits
    all fields in declaration order like Java serialization.  But in contrast to Java it will omit the fields of parent
    classes last while Java serialization emits them first.  This makes it difficult to match a given XML schema that
    defined inherited types or leads sometimes to obscure initialization problems.  However, XStream itself will not be
    affected by the changed order of elements in the XML, any deserialization of current XML representations will work
    fine.  Anyway we will provide with XStream 1.3 a FieldKeySorter implementation that mimics the old behaviour.  In
    the meanwhile you can enforce the new field sorting by installing the NaturalFieldKeySorter.</p>

    <h2 id="1.2.1"><b>Nov 11, 2006</b> XStream 1.2.1 released</h2>
	  <ul>
    	<li>Introduced DocumentWriter interface and generalized functionality for all writer implementations
    	creating a DOM structure (DOM4J, DOM, JDom, Xom, Xpp3Dom).</li>
        <li>Refactor of build system to use Maven 2.  Ant still supported on XStream Core.</li>
        <li>Created separate XStream Benchmark module</li>

    <h2 id="project-lead-joehni"><b>Oct 10, 2006</b>Joe Walness announcing new XStream Project Lead</h2>
      <p>I have been the XStream project lead, since it was open sourced 3 years ago. In that time, it has attracted some 
      excellent developers who have formed the foundations of the user community, made all kinds of significant improvements 
      and pushed out new releases. It's now approaching its 1000th commit.</p>

	<p>The development community that has formed around XStream has been outstanding - more than I could ever have 
	imagined. In particular, the following people have invested a lot of time into XStream, both from a technical and social point of 
	view:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>J&ouml;rg Schaible</li>
		<li>Mauro Talevi</li>
		<li>Guilherme Silveira</li>
		<li>Jason van Zyl</li>
		<li>Me (well I have!)</li>
	</ul>

	<p>Recently I have been turning my attention to other things and XStream has been very much a self sustaining project. I've 
	decided that the project would benefit from have a project lead who can invest a lot more time than I can currently offer.</p>

	<p>So, the new XStream project lead will be J&ouml;rg Schaible, who along with Mauro Talevi and Guilherme Silveira will carry 
	XStream forward. This has been happening for a long while anyway, it's just none of us ever realised or acknowledged it.</p>

	<p>Of course, I'll still be lurking around, helping the transition, having loud mouth opinions and generally annoying people in any 
	way I can... you haven't got rid of me that easily. ;) </p>

	<p>I know J&ouml;rg, Mauro and Guilherme will be able carry XStream into the next generation (we have a lot of ambitious plans 
	for XStream 2).</p>

	<p>I'd also like to thank the 45(!) other <a href="team.html">contributers</a> to the XStream project, who have all helped 
	make it what it is today. Finally, thanks to Graham Glass, who's Electric XML library formed a lot of the inspiration for XStream.</p>
